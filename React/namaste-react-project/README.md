## 💖 This Repository was trending on [Github](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JsBAa-DXeGIvJ_xIaYjjZ5uc3z4XV8Tz/view) 🔥

- I made [🚀 FoodFire App 😍](https://foodfire-app.netlify.app/) from scratch using React.js and Parcel.js, which is the part of this course.

Note: To Fix the `CORS` Issue in [FoodFire App](https://foodfire-app.netlify.app/), I have created [FoodFire Server](https://github.com/chetannada/FoodFire-Server) a GitHub Repository, which gives own server URL. For Instance: `https://foodfire.onrender.com`
